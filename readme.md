## RubyLinkedList

An implementation of the doubly [Linked List] data structure in Ruby with specs.

`demo.rb` contains a sample algorithm problem solved using the `Link` and `DoublyLinkedList` classes.

## Methods

### Link
* `#insert(link)` - Add a link as a child of the current link.
* `#remove` - Remove current link from parent.

### DoublyLinkedList
* `#push(link)` - Push a new link to the end of the list.
* `#pop` - Remove the last link from the list.

## Todo
* Write specs for demo algorithm problem using Link and DoublyLinkedList classes.
